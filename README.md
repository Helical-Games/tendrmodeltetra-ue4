# TendrModelTetra

Welcome to Tendr Dynamics' open-source TendrModelTetra plugin release.

This TendrModelTetra plugin is an extension for our [Tendr soft-body physics plugin](http://tendrdynamics.com/) for Unreal Engine 4. It adds the ability to generate Tendr soft models based on a tetrahedral mesh generation algorithm using a modified version of the open-source [TetGen](http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/) library by the [Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS)](http://www.wias-berlin.de/).

Note that the Tendr plugin is necessary in order for this plugin to function. If you don't have a copy of Tendr yet, be sure to keep checking for our upcoming release at [tendrdynamics.com](http://tendrdynamics.com/).

## License

Our source code contains a fork of TetGen (version 1.5.0) which has been released under the Affero GPL license, and thus our plugin is also covered under the same license. Please see the LICENSE file for more information.

Additionally, we have made a few necessary adjustments to TetGen and encourage people to contribute back to the Tetgen project by improving this code!

## Support

This plugin has been tested with Unreal Engine 4.12 and Visual Studio Community 2015.
